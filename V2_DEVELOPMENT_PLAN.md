# Version 2.0 Development Plan

## Branch Strategy Overview

**Production Branch:**
- `main` - Stable v1.0 releases, pip installable from GitHub

**Development Branches:**
- `develop` - Main integration branch for v2.0 development (version: 2.0.0.dev1)

**Feature Branches:**
- `feature/v2-pypi-packaging` - Enhanced PyPI distribution and packaging
- `feature/v2-modular-servers` - Modular MCP server architecture 
- `feature/v2-workspace-extension` - Advanced workspace management features

## Version 2.0 Goals

### 🎯 Primary Objectives

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Memory system extracted to reusable package ✅ 
   - Separate server modules for different functionalities
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **Enhanced Distribution**
   - Official PyPI package publication
   - Improved pip installation experience
   - Multiple installation options (core, extensions, all)

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Extended workspace management
   - Enhanced memory capabilities
   - Improved API design

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline ✅
   - Automated testing across platforms
   - Code quality gates and security scanning

### 🏗️ Development Workflow

```
main (v1.x stable)           ← Stable releases, user installations
├── develop (v2.0.x-dev)    ← Integration branch
    ├── feature/v2-pypi-packaging
    ├── feature/v2-modular-servers  
    └── feature/v2-workspace-extension
```

### 📦 Package Structure Evolution

**Current (v1.0):**
```
first-mcp/
├── server.py (monolithic)
├── src/first_mcp/memory/ (extracted ✅)
└── supporting modules
```

**Target (v2.0):**
```
first-mcp/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/          # first-mcp base
│   ├── workspace/     # first-mcp-workspace  
│   └── weather/       # first-mcp-weather
├── src/first_mcp/
│   ├── memory/        # Reusable memory system ✅
│   ├── servers/       # Modular server implementations
│   └── core/          # Shared utilities
```

### 🚀 Release Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Current): Architecture foundation ✅
- **Phase 2**: Feature branch development
- **Phase 3**: Integration and testing  
- **Phase 4**: v2.0.0 release preparation

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**Automated Testing:**
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Python 3.13 compatibility
- Package installation verification
- Code quality and security scanning

**Quality Gates:**
- Black code formatting
- Ruff linting  
- MyPy type checking
- Bandit security analysis
- Safety dependency checking

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Push develop branch and feature branches to remote
2. **Feature Development**: Begin work on individual feature branches
3. **Integration Testing**: Regular merges to develop branch
4. **Release Preparation**: Version bumping and final testing
