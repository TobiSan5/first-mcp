First MCP Server - A comprehensive MCP server package.

This package provides modular MCP servers for various functionalities:
- Core utilities (calculator, calendar, system info)
- Memory management with TinyDB backend
- Workspace file management 
- Weather services integration

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP:

v1.0.0 [CURRENT - COMPLETE]
- âœ… Core MCP server implementation with FastMCP
- âœ… Memory system with TinyDB backend
- âœ… Weather tools (OpenWeatherMap + Yr.no)
- âœ… Workspace file I/O management
- âœ… Math and time calculators
- âœ… Auto-initialization system

v1.1.0 [COMPLETE - Architecture & Interface Optimization]
- âœ… Tool pruning: 52â†’32 tools (38% reduction for better UX)
- âœ… Architecture delegation pattern: MCP â†” Server â†” Data layers
- âœ… 3-tier test structure: server/data/intelligence separation
- âœ… Proper server timestamp delegation across all tools
- âœ… Essential tools preserved: 17 core tools (10 memory + 7 database)
- âœ… Removed experimental tools: governance, aliases, maintenance

v2.0.0 [PLANNED - Modular Architecture + Smart Features]
- ðŸ“‹ Extract memory system as core package
- ðŸ“‹ Optional extensions: [workspace], [weather], [all]  
- ðŸ“‹ Ultra-simplified memory tools (2-4 tools total)
- ðŸ“‹ Smart tag management integration (from v1.1.0 research)
- ðŸ“‹ Vector embeddings and semantic search enhancement
- ðŸ“‹ Package structure: first-mcp (core) + extensions

v2.1.0 [FUTURE - Advanced Memory Features]
- ðŸ“‹ Hierarchical tagging system
- ðŸ“‹ Tag governance and approval workflows
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced semantic grouping
- ðŸ“‹ Memory relationship mapping
- ðŸ“‹ Enhanced search and retrieval

DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY:
- Transparent server-side intelligence
- Zero-complexity user experience
- Package-driven architecture
- Comprehensive testing with real data
- Progressive enhancement approach
